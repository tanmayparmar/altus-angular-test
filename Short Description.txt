The first thing is to visualize the things into mind and identify the problem. What i really have to do. The next step is to think divide problems in to parts. Like in this example i needed 2 Div(Box), 1 for  occupancy and 2nd for Form. Then i had to figrue the best solutions. Since, i was not allowed to use Bootstrap and Table for CSS. There were couple of options available for me. I created custom Table using Css. Same with the progress bar.
